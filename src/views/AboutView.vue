      <h4>Question:</h4>
      <p><em>Create a new vue.js application then using the GitHub API, fetch<br/>
      your GitHub repositories using this endpoint <br/>
      https:/api.github.com/users/{ USERNAME }/repos. <br/>
      Show a page with a list of all your repositories on GitHub (the page should<br/>
      have some form of pagination). Then create another page showing data for a<br/>
      single repo clicked from the list of repos using nested routes. Make sure to<br/>
      implement a wildcard route to catch 404 pages. NB: Good UI and Designs are important.
