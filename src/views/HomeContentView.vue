      <span>My Github Repositories:</span> The Medinasheriff gitHub repository (this repository)
      <br />
      now contains a little over 20 public repositories and some private repositories.
      <br />
      still little, but <q>Slow and steady...</q> Hopefully, the near future has me so
      good that <br />I lose count of the number of repositories that I have.

      <span className="notice">My Tech Story!</span> ToWhomItMayConcern,<br/>
      I started my tech journey around January of the year 2022 with ZERO knowledge. Now, 
      even through my battle with imposter <br/>syndrome, I have been able
      to learn enough about frontend to get me a software engineering internship<br/> 
      while also learning product design(UI/UX), and also getting 
      a UI/UX product design internship. <br />
      Like I always tell people, "I know a loooot now, yet, I haven't even began to scratch 
      the surface of tech." The journey has just begun!!!<br/>
      Yours sincerely,<br />
      Medina Folashde Sheriff.
